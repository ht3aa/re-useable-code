# 📄 getChildrenTemplate Method Documentation

This document provides an overview of how the `getChildrenTemplate()` method works within the `Test` model, and how it integrates with the custom `HasChildrenAction` and the `has-children.blade.php` view.

---

## 🧩 Purpose

The `getChildrenTemplate()` method is designed to dynamically generate a configuration array for rendering child record tables in a modal. It is used in conjunction with the `HasChildrenAction` to show related child data (like `Test2` records) in a user-friendly, tabular format.

---

## ⚙️ Structure of `getChildrenTemplate()`

This method returns an array of templates. Each template describes how a table should be built, what records it shows, and how each row is rendered.

### 🔧 Example Structure

```php
[
    [
        'count' => $this->count(), // Total number of child records
        'tableLabel' => __('test', ['count' => $this->count()]), // Table title
        'tableHeaders' => [ __('test.title') ], // Column headers
        'model' => Test2::class, // The model class of child records
        'viewPageRoute' => 'filament.sis.resources.test.view', // Route for viewing a child record
        'tableRecords' => $this->test2()->get()->map(function ($item) {
            return [
                'Id' => $item->Id, // ID for hashing
                'record' => $item, // Eloquent model instance
                'cellsLabel' => [ $item?->FullName ], // Data to be shown in each row
            ];
        }),
    ],
]
```

## 🧠 Key Concepts

### 1. `count`
Used to determine whether a table should be rendered at all (i.e., `count > 0`).

### 2. `tableLabel`
Describes what this table represents. Often includes localization and count.

### 3. `tableHeaders`
An array of strings to be shown as column headers.

### 4. `model`
The class name of the child model. Used to generate links and access policies.

### 5. `viewPageRoute`
The named route used to view individual child records. Often a Filament resource route.

### 6. `tableRecords`
An array of records with their:
- **Id**: used for route generation via Hashids.
- **record**: full Eloquent object for policy checks.
- **cellsLabel**: array of strings displayed in each table cell.

## 🧩 Integration with `HasChildrenAction`

In the `HasChildrenAction` class:

- The `modalContentFooter()` method calls the `getChildrenTemplate()` on the record.
- It renders the `has-children.blade.php` view with the `templates` array.
- Each template gets turned into a mini Filament-style table with clickable rows if the user has `view` permission.

---

## 🔐 Permission Logic

Within the Blade view, each row checks:

```php
canView: `{{ isset($record['record']) ? Auth::user()->can('view', [$template['model'], $record['record']]) : false }}`,
```

Only users with permission can click and follow the record link.

---

## 🏁 Conclusion

This setup allows for an extensible and elegant way to display related child models directly in a modal using Filament’s UI and Laravel’s permission system. You can easily add more templates to `getChildrenTemplate()` to support additional child relationships.
